5. Created my own docker image.
6. Learnt the critical concept of -d command.
7. Next aim is to fully deploy an application using docker.
8. Next aim is also to deploy multiple apps at an instance using supervisor.


# 9 AUGUST
1. Learnt the use case of docker and why it is better than virtual machines.
2. Read about the use case of docker in block book.
3. Learning to deploy any application by using docker commands in a container.
4. Learning about different servers and their use case like https,dns etc:
5. Learning about nginx server.


# 10 AUGUST
1. Learnt about the supervisor commands and implemented commands like -j,-i,-q,-k etc.
2. Learnt about supervisorctl Actions ,signals and run time security.
3. In docker learning to deploy applications in containers.For that developing my own login page that uses flask,mysql on 
   the backend  and html,bootstrap and css for frontend.
4. Learning about docker compost files to deploy applications.


# 12 AUGUST
 1. Build docker image of flosight and run it as learning.
 2. Tried installing and running the blockbook manually.Faced some issues so left it at that time.
 3. Learnt the creation of docker file where the base image is not imported while the docker image is being created.
 4. Worked on my self learning project of creating a backend database storing login details of users and then to deploy 
    that finally on docker.


# 14 AUGUST
Tried installing blockbook again and tried to resolove errors taking help of chatgpt,bard,stack overflow.
Tried to learn some linux commands as it was continously required in installing such setups so thought of it as a mandate to have good idea about it.
Worked on my self learning assigment and tried to install psql by using its docker image.

# 16 AUGUST
Changed my system to solve compatibility issues and reinstalled all necessary softwares.
Continued with my self practise of linux commands and tried the installation of blockbook again by referring to the github access of ranchimall given to me.
Spent the next two hours in setting up psql and successfully was able to run it by using docker via Dbeaver software.
Researched and implemented methods for backing up and restoring data from my Dockerized database.


# 17 AUGUST
Designed a simple microservices architecture with multiple Docker containers.
Explored service discovery tools like Consul or etcd to manage communication between microservices.
Successfully created the docker file for the previously built docker image of flosight.


# 18 AUGUST
Implemented load balancing for different microservices using tools like Nginx or HAProxy.
Was unable to run at first instance so took some time to research on it by using tools like stackoverflow and gfg(geeksforgeeks)to have a better understanding of this topic.
Again tried to implement blockbook installation but was stuck again by some unwanted errors on the last step of the documentation that I was reffering to.
Ended the day in watching  some youtube vidoes that would help solving this issue.


# 19 AUGUST
Finished the previous backlogs and then read about my next topic CI/CD pipeline.
Also rewatched a teams session hosted by Abhijeet sir where I learnt about the different layers in which the whole execution of transaction takes place in our app.
Continued my self learning on CI/CD pipelines.
Next aim is to set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins or GitLab CI to build and test Docker images.


# 20 AUGUST
Was unwell so could not open lapotop in the first half of the day .
Installed tools like Jenkins to implement CI/CD pipelines using docker.
Next goal is to be able to configure automated image builds triggered by code changes in a repository.
Tomorrow the goal is to be able to implement CI/CD pipelines and further revise all the docker content that I have previously learnt and executed.
Further I want to switch to linux so via virtual box would set the enviornment for that.
Also want to finish my self learning on Docker Orchestration with Kubernetes.


# 21 AUGUST
Installed ubuntu to run applications on linux.
Successfullly installed blockbook and was able to manually run it using the instructions posted on github.
Faced issue in logging into the server given via the username and the given password.
Henceforth would look to successfully login into the server tomorrow.
Then would finish my backlog activities and would convert all files till date into a single README.md file to make it more presentable.
