 Build docker image of flosight and run it as learning.
 Tried installing and running the blockbook manually.Faced some issues so left it at that time.
 Learnt the creation of docker file where the base image is not imported while the docker image is being created.
 Worked on my self learning project of creating a backend database storing login details of users and then to deploy that finally on docker.
