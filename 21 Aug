Installed ubuntu to run applications on linux.
Successfullly installed blockbook and was able to manually run it using the instructions posted on github.
Faced issue in logging into the server given via the username and the given password.
Henceforth would look to successfully login into the server tomorrow.
Then would finish my backlog activities and would convert all files till date into a single README.md file to make it more presentable.
