Was unwell so could not open lapotop in the first half of the day .
Installed tools like Jenkins to implement CI/CD pipelines using docker.
Next goal is to be able to configure automated image builds triggered by code changes in a repository.
Tomorrow the goal is to be able to implement CI/CD pipelines and further revise all the docker content that I have previously learnt and executed.
Further I want to switch to linux so via virtual box would set the enviornment for that.
Also want to finish my self learning on Docker Orchestration with Kubernetes.
