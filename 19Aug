Finished the previous backlogs and then read about my next topic CI/CD pipeline.
Also rewatched a teams session hosted by Abhijeet sir where I learnt about the different layers in which the whole execution of transaction takes place in our app.
Continued my self learning on CI/CD pipelines.
Next aim is to set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins or GitLab CI to build and test Docker images.
