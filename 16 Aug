Changed my system to solve compatibility issues and reinstalled all necessary softwares.
Continued with my self practise of linux commands and tried the installation of blockbook again by referring to the github access of ranchimall given to me.
Spent the next two hours in setting up psql and successfully was able to run it by using docker via Dbeaver software.
Researched and implemented methods for backing up and restoring data from my Dockerized database.
